# JSpector

## Diff with Original

This fork has the following customizations:
- consider only urls which are in scope
- exclude uninteresting file types
- exclude false positives based on a list of known ones
- do not report dangerous methods (imho uninteresting as usually false positive)

## Original

JSpector is a Burp Suite extension that passively crawls JavaScript files and automatically creates issues with URLs, endpoints and dangerous methods found on the JS files.
